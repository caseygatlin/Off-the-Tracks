TracksInro,1,0,38,Tracks,"This map demonstrates various track setup and options.<br>Tracks are powered by splines, this map will give you<br>some concrete examples of how they can be used,<br>but it's worth experimenting with them outside of the<br>rail system if they are new to you.<br><br>Tracks can be joined together to form complex layouts.<br>Check out the documentation for more<br>detailed breakdowns of how the tracks connect together.<br>But if you hate reading, this map should give you<br>everything you need."
TrackBasics,1,1,38,Track Basics,"All tracks have a start and an end point. Green = start, Orange = End.<br>When one track is connected into another, the arrows disappear."
TrackConnections,1,2,38,Track Connections,For trains to move from one track to another the tracks must be<br>connected. You can control the min distance tracks should be<br>apart in the 'Build Options'
ActiveConnection,1,3,38,Active Connection,"When a track has multiple connections, it can be told which one to<br>use. This is called the 'active connection'. The start and end point<br>of each track has one. See 'Active connection options'."
RandomConnection,1,4,38,Random Connection,Here the track picks one of the multiple connections at random.<br>This is the 'End_UseRandomConnection' option.
TrackConnIgnore,1,5,38,Ignoring Track Connections,"When you have multiple tracks in the same location, you might<br>want some of them to be ignored by a specific track.<br>Add any tracks to ignore in the 'connection options'."
SplineIgnore,1,6,38,Spline Components,"By default any spline component in a track is considered a track spline.<br>If you want a spline to be ignored by the track,<br>just add the tag 'ChooChooIgnore' to it."
SplineConnections,1,7,38,Spline Connections,"There are no restrictions on connections between tracks.<br>Here we have two tracks, each with multiple splines<br>all interconnected"
BuildOptions,1,8,38,Build Options,Build options allow you to speed up track building by disabling<br>options such as mesh building and connection building.
ClosedLoops,1,9,38,Loop / Closed Loops,"You can connect a track into itself to form a loop.<br>Tracks also support closed loop splines, but for best results, we<br>recommend connecting the two ends if a closed loop is needed"
TrackUpDir,1,10,38,Up Direction,"You can change the 'Up Direction' in the build options of the track.<br>By default up is positive Z, but by inverting it you can create a<br>hanging track."
ForceUpDir,1,11,38,Force Up Dir,You can use the up dir on each spline point if needed for special twists<br>or effects. Use Set up dir for all spline points in the track<br>Build Options to force the up dir
AdvancedSpline,1,12,38,Advanced Spline Shapes,You can use splines to create almost any track design you want.<br>It's worth spending some time experimenting and getting used to the<br>point and tangent controls
LoopTheLoops,1,13,38,Loop The Loop,"Here we have two example loops.<br>The first is created from four track pieces rotated into place.<br>The second created is a single track, the spline points and<br>tangents rotated to form the loop."
ActorMerging,1,14,38,Actor Merging,"When you're done building your tracks, you might want to convert<br>them to a single static mesh. This can be done with the actor<br>merge tool: Window -> Developer Tools -> Merge Actors.<br>Just disable mesh building on the track and add your new mesh.<br>On the left, the original track, on the right, the merged track"
ConnectionRebuilding,1,15,38,Connection Rebuilding,"See the docs for detailed info on using this. It's important.<br>TLDR; Blueprint has no event for deleting actors,<br>so if you do, some track connections will vanish.<br>Keep this in your level and move it if you delete any track."
TerrainTrack,1,16,38,Terrain Train Track,This simple tool allows you to quickly create tracks over uneven terrain.<br>Combine this with actor merging for rapid mesh development.<br>Currently only single spline tracks are supported.

CarriageIntro,2,0,38,Train Carriages,"This map uses scaled down carriages to save on space.<br>Here youâ€™ll see examples of carriage setup, such as using<br>offsets to control the look of the bogies and the body<br>mesh.<br><br>Options controlling the type of carriage as well as how the<br>carriage uses the track itâ€™s attached to.<br><br>Also included in the carriage examples is the end of track<br>options, this controls how the carriage reacts when it<br>reaches the end of the track."
BogieInfo,2,1,38,Bogies,"This is a 'bogie', the name may very depending on your country.<br>A train carriage must have at least one of these.<br>They have two by default."
CarriageTypes,2,2,38,Carriage Types,The system currently has two types of carriages:<br>Engine: Moves by itself and can pull other carriages.<br>Carriage: Needs an engine to pull it along the tracks.
BodyBogieSetup,2,3,38,Body and Bogie setup,Bogies and the carriage body offsets can be used to customize<br>your carriage to any setup.
WheelAnimSpeed,2,4,38,Wheel Animation Speed,The 'wheel anim speed scale' in the visual options allows you to<br>change the speed at which the animation is played. It is multiplied<br>by the current carriage speed to give the final playback speed.
BogieRollOnBody,2,5,38,Use Bogie roll on Body,Depending on your setup or what you're building you<br>can disable the roll applied to the carriage body.
AttachedSplineIndex,2,6,38,Attached Spline Index,"If the track you're attaching to consists of more than one track<br>spline, you can set the attached index in the 'track settings'<br>under 'Attached track spline index'.<br>If the supplied index is invalid, it will default back to spline 0"
EOTBrakeAndStopIfPossible,2,8,22,End Of Track<br>Brake And Stop If Possible,"When the sensor detects the end of the track the brakes<br>will be applied, if the carriage doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
EOTBrakeAndAlwaysStop,2,9,22,End Of Track<br>Brake And Always Stop,"Brakes will be applied and no matter what, the train will stop at the end of the track"
EOTBrakeAndReverseDir,2,10,22,End Of Track<br>Brake And Reverse Direction,"Brakes will be applied and if the train stops before the end of the track,<br>it will reverse direction, if it doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
EOTAlwaysStop,2,11,22,End Of Track<br>Brake And Always Stop,"Brakes will be applied and if the train stops before the end of the track,<br>it will reverse direction, if it doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
EOTDerail,2,12,22,End Of Track<br>Derail,"Brakes will be applied and if the train stops before the end of the track,<br>it will reverse direction, if it doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
EOTInstantReverse,2,13,22,End Of Track<br>Instantly Reverse Direction,"Brakes will be applied and if the train stops before the end of the track,<br>it will reverse direction, if it doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
EOTWarp,2,14,22,End Of Track<br>Warp to starting location,"Brakes will be applied and if the train stops before the end of the track,<br>it will reverse direction, if it doesn't stop in time, it will derail"
DisableBogie,2,15,38,Disable Rear Bogie,"You can disable the rear bogie if your setup needs it.<br>A good example of this is the mine cart, which only needs one.<br>The option is in the 'carriage settings' section."
CarriageState,2,16,38,Carriage State,"Carriages have states, such as stopped, moving or derailed.<br>The carriage automatically moves between these states as needed.<br>Should you need to set it manually there's a set state function that will<br>propagated down to children carriages."

EnginePhysicsIntro,3,0,38,Engine and Physics,"This map demonstrates the various carriage setups you<br>can have in relation to speed and physics.<br>Trains can use constant speeds if you want them to move<br>around the track at constant speed and not care about<br>mass, inclines, or other real world factors. A good place to<br>use constant speeds would be in a roller coaster.<br><br>With constant speeds disabled, the train will be affected by<br>mass, gravity, acceleration, friction and incline. Trains use<br>positive acceleration to move forward and negative to<br>go back. If a train doesn't have enough acceleration to<br>get up a hill, it will roll back."
ConstSpeed,3,1,38,Constant Speed,"Carriages can use acceleration or constant speeds.<br>This example uses constant speed. When using constant speed the<br>carriage will use the max speed as its current speed.<br>Braking is also affected by this flag, as a result a carriage will almost<br>instantly stop."
WithoutConstSpeed,3,2,38,Without constant speed,"Without constant speed, acceleration is used to calculate velocity.<br>Here we can see the mine cart start slower and work its way up to<br>max speed."
HillsAndAccel,3,3,38,Inclines and Acceleration,The incline of the track will also have an effect on the final speed.<br>Here we have a carriage that doesn't have enough acceleration to push<br>it up the hill
MassAndAccel,3,4,38,Mass and Acceleration,The mass of the carriage will also have an effect on the final speed.<br>Here we see a carriage with less mass make it up the incline with the<br>same acceleration as the previous example
CarriageRollingDownHill,3,5,38,Fun with hills,"Now that you know how how mass and acceleration effect the carriage,<br>you can have some fun. Here we have the carriage set as the type<br>carriage, meaning it gets no acceleration, it needs to be connected to<br>an engine for that.<br>Since it's on a hill, it will roll to a stop."
Deceleration,3,6,38,Deceleration,"This is the force that's applied when braking, to slow the train down.<br>Here we have two carriages, both speed up and when they hit<br>the trigger, they apply the brakes, the one with more deceleration slows<br>down faster."

CollisionIntro,4,0,38,Collision,"There are a lot of collision options. You can mix<br>and match options to get a desired setup for your project.<br><br>For obstacles to be detected by the carriage, the sensor<br>must be enabled.<br>The debug tool can be used to visualize the sensor <br>and other bogies.<br><br>Debug prints will show what's blocking the sensor,<br>if a roll check resulted in a derail."
SensorBogie,4,1,38,Sensor,"Each carriage places a sensor in front of the carriage.<br>This is used to detect obstacles on the track. Here we use the track<br>debug tool to visualize it as it moves around the track with the carriage.<br>Step in front of the sensor, and it will stop the train and wait for you<br>to move."
SensorCustom,4,2,38,Sensor Customization,"You can change the size, distance, offsets and many attributes<br>for the sensor.<br>Or, you can completely disable it if your project doesn't need it."
CollisionFilter,4,3,38,Collision Filtering,"By default the collision is setup to detect all collision types.<br>You can change this to meet the needs of your project, in this example,<br>pawns have been removed from the 'Collision Query Types', try<br>stepping in front of the carriage now and it won't stop for you."
MinObstacleSize,4,4,38,Min Obstacle Size,"This allows you to ignore objects that are smaller than a certain size.<br>In this example we see the big cube block the train, but the smaller<br>one is ignored.<br>Combine this with custom collision channels for serious flexibility."
ObstacleResponse,4,5,38,Obstacle Response,"When the carriage detects an obstacle on the track it can react in<br>different ways.<br>These are called obstacle responses and can be set in the<br>collision settings.<br>In this example, the carriage will derail as soon as it detects an obstacle."
CollisionIgnore,4,6,38,Collision Ignore,"You can tell the sensor or collision bogies to ignore actors.<br>They can permanently ignore an actor or have a timed ignore.<br>In this example the sensor is set to derail if it detects an obstacle, but the box is on the ignore list."
Derail,4,7,38,Derail,"Carriages can derail for a variety of reasons. When they derail the<br>speed of travel is use along with the derail force to generate the derail<br>impulse that's applied to the carriage as it leaves the track.<br>Here we have an example with two mine carts, each with a different<br>derail force."
CollisionBogies,4,8,38,Collision Bogies,Two bogies are automatically added to the carriage. One at the front<br>and one at the rear. The offsets and size of each are fully customizable.<br>You can see them displayed here using the debug tool.<br>These are used to detect and respond to impacts on the carriage.
ImpactCollision,4,9,38,Impact Collision / Plow,"The collision bogies can be setup to repel items they hit.<br>The is enabled / disabled with the 'impact collision enabled' option.<br>When enabled the plow force is applied to the impacted item.<br>Here we have two examples, one with it enabled, and one without."
FunWithHills2,4,10,38,Fun With Hills 2,Here we see an engine trying to push itself up the hill<br>while gravity pulls it down.

EffectsIntro,5,0,38,Effects,"Effects is the name given to various post move updates<br>that can be added to a carriage for visual impact.<br><br>The lean effect causes a carriage to lean from one side to<br>another based on the bend in the tracks.<br><br>The roll effect is used if you want a carriage to derail if it's<br>going around a corner that's too sharp.<br><br>The lean and roll effects are in every carriage, but you can<br>add custom effects if you need them. Check out the<br>triggers example map, in it a jump effect has been added<br>to just mine carts."
LeanEffect,5,1,38,Lean Effect,The lean effect causes a carriage to lean in or out of a turn it is taking.<br>This example uses a positive lean value.
NegativeLean,5,2,38,Lean Effect,Here we see a carriage with a negative lean value
BogieLean,5,3,38,Lean on Bogies,The lean effect can be enabled / disabled for the bogies
RollCheck,5,4,38,Roll Check,"The roll check is used to derail a carriage if it's taking a turn that's<br>too sharp.<br>The yaw, pitch and roll thresholds can be set in the roll settings.<br>Roll uses a separate derail force so you can customize it further"
RollCheckEval,5,5,38,Roll Check Eval Type,"The roll check evaluate per axis.<br>In this example only the Yaw is evaluated, allowing the carriage<br>to go down steep hills and only derail on a sharp turn left or right."

TriggersIntro,6,0,38,Triggers,"Triggers are used to generate events in the game world.<br><br>When the carriage moves into a trigger region,<br>the trigger will be fired. Each trigger can be customized to<br>filter how and when the trigger can be fired.<br><br>All trigger events have the firing carriage and bogie<br>passed into the trigger so you can filter."
Triggers,6,1,38,Triggers,Here we have a trigger that will apply the brakes to any carriage that<br>passes over it
TriggerRegions,6,2,38,Trigger Regions,"In the editor triggers are displayed as a sphere.<br>In reality they are sections of the track, we call these trigger regions.<br>This trigger prints a message on the screen."
TriggerSplineIndex,6,3,38,Trigger Spline Index,If you're attaching a trigger to a track with more than one spline<br>you can specify which spline it should use.<br>This way you can create different effects for different locations<br>on the track.<br>Here we have the brakes applied only to the carriage on the outside track.
TriggerAllSplines,6,4,38,Trigger Across All Splines,"If you want a trigger to effect all splines on a track, you can do it.<br>In this example the brake trigger is applied to all splines on the track."
JunctionTrigger,6,5,38,Junction Trigger,You can build a trigger to anything you need.<br>Here is an example of a trigger that switches the active connection<br>on the track so the second carriage takes a different route.
TriggerOptions,6,6,38,Trigger Options,"Trigers are designed to be customized and extended.<br>Each comes with a host of options, such as trigger once per carriage,<br>ignore helper bogies, and many more.<br>The events allow you to quickly setup custom triggers."
JumpTrigger,6,7,38,Jump Trigger,"While the jump trigger was designed to make the mine cart jump,<br>it can also scale and rotate.<br>Seen here you can use it to create some fun effects.<br>This is also an demo of the mine cart implementing logic on top of the<br>parent carriage class."

TrainsOverview,7,0,38,Trains,"Trains are chains of carriages.<br>There are two types of carriages, the 'engine' type<br>and the 'carriage' type. A train must have the engine as the<br>parent.<br><br>To create a train, add an engine to the tracks, then add<br>any carriages you want, just set the parent in the child<br>carriage using the selector.<br><br>By default parent settings are passed down to the<br>child carriages, but this can be disabled."
CreatingTrains,7,1,38,Creating Trains,"Trains, or a chain of carriages need the parent to be an engine,<br>this can be set in the carriage settings.<br>Just select the engine as the parent carriage and the child will snap<br>into location.<br>The parent engine will set the speed for all children."
ChildSettings,7,2,38,Parent Child Settings,Changes to the parent carriage are automatically passed down<br>to the children. This can be disabled should you need to customize<br>individual carriages.<br>UpdateSettingsFromParent function can be expanded to pass down<br>more or remove certain settings.
DistanceCheck,7,3,38,Distance Check,"With the distance check enabled, the child carriage will check<br>its distance to the parent, if it goes outside the limit, the carriage<br>will disconnect from the parent."
ParentLerpSpeed,7,4,38,Parent lerp speed,"Child carriages get their speed from their parents. The child carriage<br>will then lerp to this value.<br>By controlling the lerp you can create a nice speed up, speed down effect.<br>This effect is best viewed riding on the carriage, viewing the<br>connection between carriages, as shown in the screenshot on the left."

CoasterIntro,8,0,38,Coaster Example,"This is a simple coaster example. The whole track setup<br>took less than 7 minutes.<br>This is a perfect example map for actor merging.<br>You'll notice with large track pieces like this it takes<br>longer to load, merging the spline mesh into a static mesh<br>will speed this up.<br><br>This is a quick example to illustrate rapid setup and<br>prototyping, in a real project you'll want to spend a<br>bit more time on the spline bends to get them looking<br>perfect."

RollIntro,9,0,38,Roll Examples,"This map contains examples that show off the roll feature.<br>This will allow you to create tracks<br>with advanced twists and turns, like<br>a corkscrew or banking.<br><br>NOTE: It's important to understand that the roll option<br>is a visual and will require the spline point to be rotated<br>to work.<br><br>See the examples for more details and the documentation."
PointRotation,9,1,38,Point Rotation,"Spline points must be rotated so the carriage follows the track.<br>Unreal currently does not allow Blueprint to set the spline point roll.<br>So it must be done by hand. To visualize this, in the track options<br>enable 'Show Up Dir' or 'Show Up Dir For All Points'"
RollVisualization,9,2,38,Roll Visualization,"You can visualize the roll by enabling the track option 'Show Roll Info'.<br>Each track has a start, middle and end roll."
VisualVsRotation,9,3,38,Roll vs. Rotation,"Here you can see a track that has visual roll, but the spline point<br>hasn't been rotated, so the mine cart behaves as if the track is level."
RotationTutorial,9,4,38,Roll Tutorial,"To rotate the spline point, select it in the editor and use the rotation tool.<br>The arrow can be used as a visual indicator."
MiddleRollSoften,9,5,38,Middle Roll Soften,"To keep extreme bends looking smooth, you can use the<br>'middle roll soften' option to even out the bend in the middle of the track."


SmoothIntro,10,0,38,Movement Smoothing,Movement smoothing allows you to<br>exercise more control over the carriage<br>movement on the tracks to create a smoother movement.<br><br>The carriage in red has no smoothing<br>turned on and as a result you can<br>see a slight stutter as it moves.<br>The carriage in green has it turned<br>on and the stutter is drastically reduced.<br><br>See the documentation for more details.
SmoothRotScale,10,1,24,Adjust Smoothing based on Rotation,"You can have the smoothing error tolerance adjust based on the track<br>rotation, this is handy for carriages rolling down hills."

CableCarIntro,11,0,38,Cable Car Example,This example shows how you can quickly build<br> more than just trains with the system.

TerrainIntro,12,0,38,Terrain Tracks,"Terrain tracks allow you to quickly<br>build tracks over landscapes or<br>uneven surfaces.<br><br>For each point on the spline a ray<br>will be cast down and where it<br>hits is where the track is placed,<br>allowing you to quickly build tracks<br>in large open world maps.<br><br>Take the time to check out the<br>examples and to understand track baking<br>to maximize performance.<br><br>As always, the docs have more info."
TerrainTrackBasics,12,1,38,Terrain Tracks Basics,"The tracks are simple, if the ray hits something<br>the track is placed at the hit point under it.<br>Move the control spline to place the track spline under it."
TerrainTrackPointCount,12,2,32,More points = More precision,"The more points you have, the better the result.<br>Here you can see a track with 2 points vs 8.<br>The green track has been merged."
TerrainTangents,12,3,38,Copying Tangents,You can copy tangents from the control spline to the track spline.<br>Having control like this is very useful when going from terrain to<br>a straight piece of track.
TerrainLargeExample,12,4,38,Large Example,Just a large real example of how the terrain track<br>can be used.
TerrainBake,12,5,32,Baking To Improve Performance,"Bake your tracks for max performance. When you're happy<br>with your track, bake it to a normal track<br>so it doesn't need to use line traces."
